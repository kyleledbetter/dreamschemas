Dreamschemas - CSV to Supabase Schema Converter
Product Requirements Document v1.0

Introduction
Dreamschemas is an intelligent CSV-to-database schema converter designed specifically for Supabase developers. The application transforms raw CSV data into production-ready Postgres database schemas through AI-powered analysis, providing visual schema editing capabilities and seamless Supabase project integration.
The tool eliminates the manual, error-prone process of analyzing CSV structure and creating database schemas by leveraging Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model to intelligently infer column types, relationships, and constraints. Users can upload one or multiple CSV files, receive AI-generated schema suggestions, visually edit the proposed structure, and deploy directly to new or existing Supabase projects.
Target Users:

Full-stack developers migrating data to Supabase
No-code/low-code builders working with CSV imports
Data engineers setting up new Supabase projects
Teams prototyping applications with existing datasets

Problem Statement:
Converting CSV data to properly structured Postgres schemas requires deep database knowledge, manual column type mapping, relationship identification, and understanding of Postgres best practices. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in suboptimal database designs.

Goals
Primary Business Goals

Accelerate Supabase Adoption: Reduce friction in migrating existing data to Supabase projects
Democratize Database Design: Enable developers without deep SQL knowledge to create production-ready schemas
Improve Data Quality: Ensure proper column types, constraints, and relationships through AI analysis
Streamline Development Workflow: Integrate schema creation directly into the Supabase ecosystem

Technical Goals

Intelligent Schema Generation: Achieve 90%+ accuracy in column type inference and relationship detection
Visual Schema Management: Provide intuitive drag-and-drop schema editing with real-time validation
Seamless Integration: Enable one-click deployment to Supabase with OAuth authentication
Universal Compatibility: Support deployment across local development, Bolt.new, and Netlify environments
Performance Optimization: Process CSV files efficiently with client-side analysis for smaller files and Supabase Storage for larger datasets

User Experience Goals

Intuitive Workflow: Complete CSV-to-production schema in under 5 minutes
Visual Feedback: Real-time schema visualization with clear relationship mapping
Error Prevention: Validate schemas before deployment with helpful error messages
Progressive Enhancement: Support both manual upload and drag-and-drop file handling
